                <h3>About Company</h3>
                <p>At the heart of ORGANIC INDIA is our commitment to be a living embodiment of love and consciousness in action. We work with thousands of small family farmers in India to cultivate tens of thousands of acres of sustainable organic farmland.<br />
                    All ORGANIC INDIA products support health and True Wellness and are made with loving care. Each product is one link in a chain of connectedness between Mother Nature, our farmers and you. By choosing ORGANIC INDIA you are completing this chain, actively participating in our mission to create a sustainable environment of True Wellness, providing training and a life of dignity to our farmers, and bringing health, happiness and True Wellness to you.<br />
                    All of our farmers and tribal wildcrafters are educated in organic and biodynamic agricultural practices. We pay all the fees associated with acquiring the necessary organic certifications for them, and then we purchase the harvested crops and herbs at a premium market price. The farmers also rotate between growing crops on their land for ORGANIC INDIA with food crops for themselves. This means farming families are supported by a sustainable income, while at the same time improving and preserving their own health and natural environment.<br />
                    ORGANIC INDIA is committed to being a trustworthy and innovative global leader by providing genuine True Wellness products. Our advanced processing methods and dehydration technologies ensure that our herbs retain their maximum level of potency for the highest quality, most effective, pure and natural True Wellness products available in the market today. Our success serves as living proof that shared abundance can be created with an uncompromising commitment to environmental and social responsibility. In living this vision, we are inspired to introduce a new standard for new paradigm companies:<br />
